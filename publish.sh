# This "Publish" script SHOULD perform ALL steps necessary to make the defined
# server be "production ready". This means ONLY production is supported by 
# this script. If another environment should be setup for "testing", this 
# script (and others) must be upgraded. Also note: this is not set up to be a
# service, it is instead run as myself.
# TODO: THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY! Make the product a SERVICE run and owned
# by a user other than yourself, and restart the service upon installation.

# Publish steps: 
# - Completely rebuild the binaries to local publish
# - Extract schema from master database
# - Copy extra dependencies (langauge, dbmigrations) to local publish
# - Copy publish to remote at install location
# - Set up remote system (permissions, services(?), dbmigrations, etc)
